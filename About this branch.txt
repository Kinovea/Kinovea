Attached drawings:
- Save tool type in the button Tag property -> Group all event handler into one for tool selection.
- Introduction of the Capabilities concept implemented by each drawing, to know which generic context menu we should show (configure, fading, opacity).
- When drawing have specific right click menu (like "ShowÂ Measure") they are stored inside the drawing itself and added dynamically on right click.
- Port of these simplifications to the Capture screen. (+ port of the ToolPointer variable simplification).
- Migration of the LocateForm helper function to ScreenManagerKernel, so it's not duplicated between screens.
- Migration of the showmeasure and show coordinates flags into the corresponding tools as static properties. (previously as bool in each screen UI)
TODO: fix color profile mess.

Unattached drawings:
- Tracks merged into the list of ExtraDrawings.
- Fixed Chrono commands (undo/redo for add, delete, modify).
- Fixed Tracks commands (undo/redo for delete, delete end).

2011/04/07 - Actual branch creation under SVN

Done at this point:

1. For Attached drawings
- AbstractDrawing stripped of non universally implemented methods.
- Creation of a few interfaces for decorations (line style, color), xml export, setup of the tool.
- Adaptation of all existing drawings to this new framework.


2. For Unattached drawings
- Grid & Plane (same class) to conform and inherit AbstractDrawing.
- Metadata.SetLocations replaces Metadata.Plane.SetLocations and Metadata.Grid.SetLocations, to avoid exposing Grid and Plane to the outside.
- Concept of ExtraDrawings list in Metadata to hold all the unattached drawings and treat them as a list.
- Chronometer objects (already conformant to AbstractDrawing) are added to the extra drawings list.
- hit test, move and movehandle in left click (Pointer tool) use the new extra drawing list instead of separate treatments for Grids and Chrono.
- Temporarily Deactivated undo/redo support for Chronometer add, delete, modify.
- Track made conformant to AbstractDrawing.

2011/04/05 - Sandbox branch

This branch is to work on a refactoring of the drawing and drawing tools framework.
As a number of tools will be considered for addition, the ease of these addition is questionned.

The problem
-----------
It is not particularly easy to add drawing tools and doing so implies modifications in many parts of the code.

Drawings are either attached to a key image (angle, line, Svg), or unattached (Track, Magnifier).
For the unattached drawings, there are unique tools (magnifier, grid, plane) and tools creating multiple instances (track, later spotlight).

Some drawings are somewhat hybrids (Chronometer).
The unattached drawings are not homogenous, there is a lot of code duplication for hit testing, they don't follow a similar interface etc.
Attached drawings herit from a class with functions not implemented by all tools. (decoration, xml export)

The approach
------------
- Unattached drawings will conform to a similar interface. It is supposed that they can actually inherit from the same type as the attached drawings (AbstractDrawing).
- We will try to treat all unattached drawings at once everywhere, using their parent type.
- Unattached drawings creating multiple instances will work with a single Manager that will proxy the requests to the individual instances.
- Attached drawings will implement a core interface and then have their extra functions defined in interfaces.
