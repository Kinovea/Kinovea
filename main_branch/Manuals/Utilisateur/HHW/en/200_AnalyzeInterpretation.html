In addition to classic technical observation,&nbsp;biomechanics study give you a more formal analysis.<br>Analysis in Kinovea operates around the concept of Key Images. A Key Image can be set anywhere in the video.<br>It is a reference point to which you can attach a comment, draw free hand, measure an angle, etc.<br><br>Key Images data can be saved independently from the video or included into it to ease sharing.<br>In order to publish your analysis (or to finish it outside Kinovea), a set of saving functions are given.<br><br>Finally a Grid and a Plan in 3D space allow you to improve your observations.<br><br><a href="201_KeyImagesCreation.html">Handling Key Images.</a> (Add Key Images, Add Comments and Drawings, Save and Import Key Images data.)<br><a href="202_ImagesExport.html">Saving Still Images.</a> (Single Image, Sequence of Images, Diaporama of Key Images, PDF document of Key Images.)<br><a href="203_VideoSaving.html">Saving Video Sequences.</a> (Saving a Video, Formats and codecs used, Including Key Images data.)<br><a href="204_Grids.html">Using the 2D Grid and the 3D Plane.</a> (Showing the grid and the plan, Manipulating them, Modifying colors.)<br><br></body></html>
