'''<Summary>This class takes the IDataObject or .Net DataObjectpassed into DragEnter
'''  and builds a IDataObject that is suitable for use when interacting with the
''' IDropTarget of a Folder.
'''Requirements:
'''  The input IDataObject must contain at least one of the following Formats and Data
'''   1. An ArrayList of CShItems
'''   2. A Shell IDList Array
'''   3. A FileDrop structure
''' A Valid instance of this class will have and expose
'''  1. Dobj -- A COM IDataObject suitable for use in interaction with a Folder's IDropTarget
'''             Dobj will have, at least, a valid Shell IDList Array representing the Dragged Items
'''  2. DragData -- An ArrayList of 1 or more CShItems representing the Dragged Items
'''Processing Steps:
'''  1. Check for presence of one or more of the required Formats with valid Data
'''  2. Build or use the provided ArrayList of CShItems
'''  3. Ensure that all items are of same FileSystem/Non-FileSystem classification
'''  4. Build or use the provided Shell IDList Array 
'''  (Note that we don't necessarily build the FileDrop structure)
'''  5. if classification is FileSystem 
'''  5a.   Store Shell IDList Array into DataObject, if not already there
'''  5b.   Obtain COM IDataObject
'''  6, Else for non-FileSystem classification
'''  6a.   Obtain the IDataObject of the Virtual Folder  (A COM object)
'''  6b.   Store Shell IDList Array into that Object
'''  7. If no errors to this point, set m_IsValid to True
'''  8. Done
''' The class also contains a number of useful shared methods for dealing with
''' IDataObject
