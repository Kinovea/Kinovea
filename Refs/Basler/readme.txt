PylonC.NET.dll is a thin wrapper around PylonC_MD_VC100.dll and is part of the SDK published by Basler. 
PylonC_MD_VC100.dll must be in the path (dev and client machine).
See for example in : C:\Program Files\Basler\Pylon 3.2\pylonc\bin\Win32.
The path is usually updated during the SDK installation.
