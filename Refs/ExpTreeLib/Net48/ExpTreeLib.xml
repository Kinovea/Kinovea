<Summary>This class takes the IDataObject or .Net DataObjectpassed into DragEnter
  and builds a IDataObject that is suitable for use when interacting with the
 IDropTarget of a Folder.
Requirements:
  The input IDataObject must contain at least one of the following Formats and Data
   1. An ArrayList of CShItems
   2. A Shell IDList Array
   3. A FileDrop structure
 A Valid instance of this class will have and expose
  1. Dobj -- A COM IDataObject suitable for use in interaction with a Folder's IDropTarget
             Dobj will have, at least, a valid Shell IDList Array representing the Dragged Items
  2. DragData -- An ArrayList of 1 or more CShItems representing the Dragged Items
Processing Steps:
  1. Check for presence of one or more of the required Formats with valid Data
  2. Build or use the provided ArrayList of CShItems
  3. Ensure that all items are of same FileSystem/Non-FileSystem classification
  4. Build or use the provided Shell IDList Array 
  (Note that we don't necessarily build the FileDrop structure)
  5. if classification is FileSystem 
  5a.   Store Shell IDList Array into DataObject, if not already there
  5b.   Obtain COM IDataObject
  6, Else for non-FileSystem classification
  6a.   Obtain the IDataObject of the Virtual Folder  (A COM object)
  6b.   Store Shell IDList Array into that Object
  7. If no errors to this point, set m_IsValid to True
  8. Done
 The class also contains a number of useful shared methods for dealing with
 IDataObject

<Summary>Constructor starting with a .Net Data object
 .Net DataObjects are easy to work with, but are useless
 if the Dragged items are non-FileSystem
 The DragWrapper class will never call this.

<member name="M:ExpTreeLib.CProcDataObject.#ctor(System.IntPtr@)">
<Summary>This constructor takes a pointer to an IDataObject obtained from a
 IDropTarget Interface's DragEnter method.
 If the pointer points to a .Net DataObject (which only happens within the same app),
 convert it and call ProcessNetDataObject
 Otherwise, it from another app, possibly Win Explorer, so
 check it for the required formats and build m_DragList.
 Any error just quits, leaving m_IsValid as False ... Caller must check

<member name="M:ExpTreeLib.CProcDataObject.MakeShellIDArray(System.Collections.ArrayList)">
<Summary>
 Shell Folders prefer their IDragData to contain this format which is
  NOT directly supported by .Net.  The underlying structure is the CIDA structure
  which is basically VB and VB.Net Hostile.
If "Make ShortCut(s) here" is the desired or
  POSSIBLE effect of the drag, then this format is REQUIRED -- otherwise the
  Folder will interpret the DragDropEffects.Link to be "Create Document Shortcut"
  which is NEVER the desired effect in this case
 The normal CIDA contains the Absolute PIDL of the source Folder and 
  Relative PIDLs for each Item in the Drag. 
  I cheat a bit an provide the Absolute PIDL of the Desktop (00, a short)
  and the Absolute PIDLs for the Items (all such Absolute PIDLS ar 
  relative to the Desktop.
