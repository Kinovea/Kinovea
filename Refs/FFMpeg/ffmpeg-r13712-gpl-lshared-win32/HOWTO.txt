
On both cases, be sure the DLLs in the /bin folder are in your PATH when you
run the program.

To use these libraries with MSVC++ you must:
- Extract this package to some folder. Be sure to not mix MSVC and MinGW
  folders;
- Get msinttypes and extract it to the same /include folder as above;
- Add the /include folder to "Additional Include Directories";
- Add the /lib folder to "Additional Library Directories";
- Add these libraries to "Additional Dependencies":
    swscale-0.lib avdevice-52.lib avformat-52.lib avcodec-51.lib avutil-49.lib
- If you are compiling C programs, "#define inline _inline" before including
  FFmpeg headers.
- If you are compiling C++ programs, "extern "C" {}" around the FFmpeg include
  files.

To use these libraries with MinGW you must:
- Extract this package to some folder. If you extract them to MinGW's default
  folders, you will not have to add any extra folder flag;
- If you have not extracted the files to MinGW's default folder, add
  "-I<path to that /include folder>" to CFLAGS;
- Ignore the .lib files from this package (you may even delete them). Instead
  copy or move the DLL files to the /lib folder;
- If you have not extracted the files to MinGW's default folder or copied or
  moved the DLLs to the /lib folder, add
  "-L<path to that /bin folder>" to LDFLAGS;
- Add these libraries to LDFLAGS:
    -lswscale -lavdevice -lavformat -lavcodec -lavutil
- If you are compiling C++ programs, "extern "C" {}" around the FFmpeg include
  files.
