    This configuration file allows to change some default values of the Baumer gige producer.
    Please keep in mind that changes will affect all devices and may lead to non-optimal behavior.
    All values were chosen to fit for the most configurations.
    If a value is out of range, deleted or cannot be used the Baumer gige producer will set a valid value,
    which is the default value in most cases. Some values can be adjusted with the Baumer SDK (see sdk support).

                               Therefore we have to wait a certain number of packets to ensure the resent package
                               has arrived in our application before requesting the packet again.
                               If incomplete frames occur this parameter can be raised to allow more time to pass
                               for the resent packet to be recovered.
