New workflow (2011-05-07)
-------------------------

. For each language :
0. Backup wiki. languages namespaces pages and media.
0. Delete previous zip export and src folder.
0. In language directory, delete web folder and .chm file.

A. Preparation :
--------------------------------
1. SiteExport namespace. (If first try goes +200 files, it failed. Do it again to get about 50 files.).
2. Extract to src/…
3. Copy images to src/…
4. Run cleanup.py to clean HTML files.
5. Update 001 and 004 (in language folder) manually.
6. 005 :
- Open datasheet template in writer.
- Open wiki exported 005.html in writer, turn everything to Arial 10.
- Copy table rows over the odt datasheet. Possile to copy multiple rows at once (per theme)
- Export as pdf
- remove logo and align header text to the left and export as xhtml as 005.html.

B. Generate CHM and online help.
--------------------------------
7. Paste wiki text of the toc page 000 to a new master.txt file.
8. run generate-help.py it will : 
- Create intermediary toc pages (100, 113, etc.)
- Copy 001, 004, 005 to src/….
- Create project and toc files for HTML Workshop
- Run CHM compiler.
- Create toc.htm for online help (ndoc style)
- Copy topic files to /web
- Copy chm and web folder to the language directory

At the end the language directory should contain:
- the chm file
- the web folder
- the datasheet pdf (manual export from the odt).

>> Repeat with another language.

Notes:
The master datasheet odt is created for english language.
Then its content is ported on the wiki 005 page for translation.
The datasheet odt for each language is created from the english one with translations backported from the wiki to the odt.
